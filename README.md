# my_daily_exercise

A new Flutter project.

## Running the project

This project added packages utilizing `build_runner` and `json_serializable` to generate code for serialization and deserialization of JSON data. To run the project, you need to run the following command:

```bash
dart run build_runner watch -d
```

This command will generate the necessary code for the project to run. After running the command, you can run the project as you would normally do in a new terminal window:

```bash
flutter run
```
